          <p>In the sixth richest economy on Earth, it ought to be a given that nobody goes hungry, that people get a
              fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work, and everyone has a secure and affordable place to call home. Basics
              such as food, dignity at work, and decent housing ought to be a given.
            </p>
            <p>After all, it’s just basic common decency – but these things we used to take for granted seem further away
              than ever for millions. Children starting secondary school this year have only ever known recession and
              austerity, born in a credit crunch brought on by big business, and now going to school hungry. Teachers who
              haven’t seen a real term pay increase for years are dig into their own pockets to make sure their students
              have full enough stomachs to concentrate, while juggling their own rising rents and expensive childcare.
            </p>
            <p> It is clear that more of the same will no longer do. More of the same will not change the way our economy
              distributes its rewards. More of the same cannot save our world from the climate emergency. It won’t put
              food on the table or a roof over our heads.
            </p>
            <p> As we go to the polls this winter, let us face the future. To build a fairer future, we must seek
              inspiration from the people, projects and movements who have dared to do things differently.
            </p>
            <p>Doing things differently comes naturally to co-operators. From the outset, the co-operative movement has
              challenged the status quo. It is this experience and this willingness to be disruptors which will be so
              important in facing the challenges to come. Co-operation, a global movement of more than a billion members,
              shows that our values and principles can support social justice both at home and abroad.
            </p>
            <p>This policy platform shares the ideas that the Co-operative Party wants to put at the top of the next
              Parliament’s to-do list. They are borne from the real-life experiences of our members and movement, who are
              already doing things differently across the country. Putting our co-operative values into practice on shop
              floors in every high street, through community share offers to build solar panels and save post offices, on
              marches for a public vote on any Brexit deal.
            </p>
            <p>Let us face the future, confident in our co-operative values and daring to put them into practice in every
              community. Let us build a fairer future where wealth and power are shared.

          <div class="buildingIntro">
              <p>By most measurements, our economy isn’t working. At a personal level, the UK’s current economic system is one within which homelessness and billionaires co-exist. Wealth and economic success are not fairly shared, and the economy’s rewards flow upwards without trickling back down. Productivity is low, and wage growth and living standards has been decoupled from wider economic growth. Consumers, workers and communities have a declining share in an economy which doesn’t work in their interests. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Co-operation provides an antidote to many of the economy’s failings. The original co-operative and mutual societies were created as a way for ordinary people to come together to provide mutual self-help for their members – from good quality affordable food to fair rewards for their labour and protection against sickness and unemployment.</p>
              <p>While the country is a very different place to when the Co‑operative Party was founded a century ago, the solutions offered by co‑operatives are as pertinent and important today as they were then. By existing to provide a service for their members rather than generate profits for external shareholders, co-operative and mutual enterprises are the key to creating an economy that puts people before profit.</p>
              <p>And conversely a larger co‑operative sector is a sign and measure of a different kind of economy emerging, where purpose and participation are valued above profit maximisation.</p>

            <div class="bulletAccordionP">
                <p>With values and principles at its heart, co-operative enterprise is the fairest way to do business – democratic organisations with a social purpose, operating in the interests of their members and wider communities, and sharing the dividends of success fairly.</p>
                <p>Economies characterised by a larger co‑operative sector are more equitable, productive and accountable, with a narrower gap between the rich and poor. Instead of wealth being concentrated in the hands of a small percentage at the top, co-operative economies have a wider ownership base. In communities like Emilia Romagna in Italy, co-operative enterprises generate close to 40% of GDP in the province resulting in the lowest socio-economic inequality of any region in Europe.</p>
                <p>In contrast, the UK’s economy is skewed to the interests of private business. Co-operative growth and expansion are hindered by a legislative and regulatory framework that is designed for privately-owned businesses. Despite the success of member finance and community share offers in financing community energy, co‑operative pubs and other projects and enterprises, co-operatives’ unique structure means they are often excluded from traditional investment methods. This unequal playing field places the sector at a competitive disadvantage and makes it easier for new enterprises to adopt conventional business models.</p>
                <p>It is testament, therefore, to the resilience of co-operatives that the sector is worth £37.7 billion to the economy each year – despite this hostile economic environment which creates barriers to further co-operation.</p>
